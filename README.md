# Responsible_SDX_Object-level

**Responsible_SDX_Object-level** is an **ongoing research project** focused on developing methods for **fair and safe object-level image generation** using Stable Diffusion models.

The project explores **interpretable interventions and fine-grained spatial control**, leveraging **DINO-X** mechanisms to ensure responsible image synthesis—particularly when manipulating specific objects or entities within complex scenes.

This work builds upon recent advancements in open-world object detection and understanding, as detailed in:
